# 📻 Shortwave Frequency Database (A25 · MHz Edition)

A clean, structured, and SDR-friendly version of the **A25 shortwave and broadcast frequency list**, converted entirely to **MHz** with two decimal precision.

This dataset is designed for **Shortwave Listeners (SWL)**, **DXers**, and **SDR enthusiasts** who want a ready-to-use frequency database for logging, scanning, and propagation analysis.

## 🎧 Use Cases

- 🛰️ **SDR software integration** – import the CSVs into SDR#, HDSDR, SDRUno, or other apps for live scanning.  
- 🌍 **SWL & DXing** – identify international stations, monitor bands, and log receptions.  
- 📊 **Data visualization** – analyze activity by band, region, or broadcaster.  
- 📡 **Propagation studies** – compare seasonal schedules (A25 vs B25, etc.) to detect frequency trends.
